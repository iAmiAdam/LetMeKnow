#LetMeKnow

A Location based app to let your loved ones know you're safe when travelling.

=========

This story of this app and how it came to be is really quite simple. My Mother always used to ask me to text her when I arrived somewhere, hence the name of the app. Of course, I always forgot and 
my poor mother would worry until she text me and I replied. This app solves all of the worrying. Simply input a location, choose a contact and specify a message and it does the rest, giving peace
of mind to your loved ones.
